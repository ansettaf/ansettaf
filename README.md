## 🛡️ Cybersecurity Learning Roadmap

I am currently building my cybersecurity expertise. My learning path:

### 1️⃣ Foundational & Core (Beginner)
- CompTIA Security+  
- eLearnSecurity Junior Penetration Tester (eJPT)

### 2️⃣ Specialization Paths (Intermediate)

#### 🔴 Red Team / Penetration Testing
- Skills: Exploit development, vulnerability assessment, ethical hacking  
- Certification: Offensive Security Certified Professional (OSCP)

#### 🔵 Blue Team / SOC
- Skills: Monitoring, incident response, malware analysis  
- Certifications: CompTIA CySA+, GIAC Certified Incident Handler (GCIH)

#### ☁️ Cloud Security
- Skills: Cloud infrastructure security, IAM, compliance  
- Certifications: Certified Cloud Security Professional (CCSP), AWS Certified Security - Specialty

### 3️⃣ Advanced & Leadership (Advanced)
- GIAC Certified Forensic Analyst (GCFA)  
- Offensive Security Web Expert (OSWE)  
- Certified Information Security Manager (CISM)  
- Certified Information Systems Security Professional (CISSP)

**My Approach:** Start with beginner certs → focus on Red Team → hands-on labs/CTFs → expand to Blue Team/Cloud → advanced certs.  
> Practice is key: Python automation, C for binary exploits, Java for application security.
